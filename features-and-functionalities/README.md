The backend for the Airbnb Clone has key features that align with the functionalities of a rental marketplace. The following are the 

A. Core functionalities;

1. User Management
    User Registration:
    Allow users to sign up as guests or hosts.
    Use secure authentication methods like JWT (JSON Web Tokens).
    
    User Login and Authentication:
    Implement login via email and password.
    Include OAuth options (e.g., Google, Facebook).
    Profile Management:
    Enable users to update their profiles, including profile photos, contact info, and preferences.

2. Property Listings Management
    Add Listings:
    Hosts can create property listings by providing details such as title, description, location, price, amenities, and availability.
    Edit/Delete Listings:
    Hosts can update or remove their property listings.

3. Search and Filtering
    Implement search functionality to allow users to find properties by:
    Location
    Price range
    Number of guests
    Amenities (e.g., Wi-Fi, pool, pet-friendly)
    Include pagination for large datasets.

4. Booking Management
    Booking Creation:
    Guests can book a property for specified dates.
    Prevent double bookings using date validation.
    Booking Cancellation:
    Allow guests or hosts to cancel bookings based on the cancellation policy.
    Booking Status:
    Track booking statuses such as pending, confirmed, canceled, or completed.

5. Payment Integration
    Implement secure payment gateways (e.g., Stripe, PayPal) to handle:
    Upfront payments by guests.
    Automatic payouts to hosts after a booking is completed.
    Include support for multiple currencies.

6. Reviews and Ratings
    Guests can leave reviews and ratings for properties.
    Hosts can respond to reviews.
    Ensure reviews are linked to specific bookings to prevent abuse.

7. Notifications System
    Implement email and in-app notifications for:
    Booking confirmations
    Cancellations
    Payment updates
    
8. Admin Dashboard
    Create an admin interface for monitoring and managing:
    Users
    Listings
    Bookings
    Payments

B. Technical Requirements;

1. Database Management
    Use a relational database such as PostgreSQL or MySQL.
    Required tables:
    Users (guests and hosts)
    Properties
    Bookings
    Reviews
    Payments

2. API Development
    Use RESTful APIs to expose backend functionalities to the frontend.
    Include proper HTTP methods and status codes for:
    GET (retrieve data)
    POST (create data)
    PUT/PATCH (update data)
    DELETE (remove data)
    Use GraphQL for complex data fetching scenarios (optional but recommended).

3. Authentication and Authorization
    Use JWT for secure user sessions.
    Implement role-based access control (RBAC) to differentiate permissions between:
    Guests
    Hosts
    Admins

4. File Storage (Scenario based)
    Store property images and user profile photos in cloud storage solutions such as AWS S3 or Cloudinary. For implementation, we will use file storage

5. Third-Party Services
    Use email services like SendGrid or Mailgun for email notifications.

6. Error Handling and Logging
    Implement global error handling for APIs.


C. Non-Functional Requirements:

1. Scalability
    Use a modular architecture to ensure the app scales easily as traffic increases.
    Enable horizontal scaling using load balancers.

2. Security
    Secure sensitive data (e.g., passwords, payment information) using encryption.
    Implement firewalls and rate limiting to prevent malicious activities.

3. Performance Optimization
    Use caching tools like Redis to improve response times for frequently accessed data (e.g., search results).
    Optimize database queries to reduce server load.

4. Testing
    Implement unit and integration tests using frameworks like pytest .
    Include automated API testing to ensure endpoints function as expected.
